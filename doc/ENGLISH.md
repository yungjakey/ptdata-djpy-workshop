# Data Journalism Python Tutorial

## üìö Prerequisites (Windows)

Before starting, you'll need to install:

- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Python 3.12+
- Miniconda
- PowerShell 7.2+

Don't worry if you don't have these installed yet‚Äîfollow the step-by-step instructions below.

## üîß Installation Guide for Windows

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. Launch VS Code after installation

### 2. Install PowerShell 7.2+

1. Download the installer from [Microsoft PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
2. Choose PowerShell-7.2.x-win-x64.msi or newer
3. Run the installer with default options
4. Verify by opening PowerShell 7 and running: `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion`

```bash
 $PSVersionTable.PSVersion # 7.x
```

### 3. Install Git

1. Download from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Run the installer with default options
3. Verify: Open PowerShell and run

```bash
git --version
```

### 4. Install Python 3.12

1. Go to the [Python Downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest Python 3.12.x Windows installer (64-bit)
3. Run the installer
4. **Important:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"
5. Choose "Install Now" (recommended)
6. Wait for the installation to complete
7. Verify installation by opening a new PowerShell window and typing:

```bash
python --version # 3.12.x
```

### 5. Install Miniconda

1. Go to the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Download the latest Windows 64-bit installer for Python 3.9+
3. Run the installer
4. Accept the license agreement
5. Select "Install for Just Me" (recommended)
6. Choose the install location (default is fine)
7. **Important:** Check both options:
- "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable"
- "Register Miniconda3 as my default Python environment"
8. Complete the installation
9. Verify by opening a new PowerShell window and typing:

```bash
conda --version
```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. **Conda environment not activating:**
- Run VSCode as Administrator
- Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Try activating again: `conda activate djpyworkshop`
2. **Python packages not found:**
- Ensure you've activated the conda environment
3. **Jupyter notebooks not opening:**
- Select a Kernel when opening a notebook (use the "djpyworkshop" conda environment kernel)
- Make sure the Python extension in VS Code is installed
- Restart VS Code after installing extensions
4. **Executable not found**:
- This usually means the program isn't in your PATH environment variable
- Check your PATH by opening PowerShell and running: `$env:Path -split ";"`
- You may need to add the relevant directory to your PATH:
  - Search for "Edit environment variables" in Windows
  - Edit the PATH variable and add the missing directory
  - Restart PowerShell/VS Code after making changes

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Details
### VS Code Settings (.vscode folder)
This project includes customized VS Code settings to enhance your development experience:

- **settings.json**: Pre-configured editor settings optimized for Python and Jupyter notebooks
  - Code formatting and linting with Ruff
  - Jupyter notebook settings
  - Terminal integration with conda environments

- **extensions.json**: Recommended VS Code extensions for this project
  - Python and Jupyter support
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Docker integration
  - Markdown editing support

To use these settings, simply open the project in VS Code, and you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions.

### üîÑ Development Container (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
This project includes a Development Container configuration for consistent development environments across machines:

- Preconfigured Python environment with all dependencies installed
- VS Code extensions and settings automatically applied
- Isolated environment that won't affect your local system

To use the Development Container:
1. Install the "Remote - Containers" extension in VS Code
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette: "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and start (this may take a few minutes the first time)

Once inside the container, all tools and dependencies will be ready to use without manual installation.

### Configuration Files (.config folder)
The project contains configuration files in the `.config` folder:
- **ruff.toml**: Configuration for the Ruff Python linter and formatter

These configurations ensure consistent code style and environment settings across different development environments.
