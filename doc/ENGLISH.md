2. You should now see the project files in the Explorer

   ![Close Tabs](../assets/08_close-tabs.png)

### 6. Configure Jupyer Server

Run the setup script manually to configure the Jupyter server:

**Windows (in PowerShell):**
```bash
.\scripts\setup-jupyter.ps1
```

### 7. Start Jupyer Server

This script will set up the conda environment and install all required packages.

1. Run `jupyter lab` in the Terminal

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. **Conda environment not activating:**
- Run VSCode as Administrator
- Execute: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Try activating again: `conda activate djpyworkshop`
2. **Python packages not found:**
- Ensure you've activated the conda environment
3. **Jupyter notebooks not opening:**
- Select a Kernel when opening a notebook (use the "djpyworkshop" conda environment kernel)
- Make sure the Python extension in VS Code is installed
- Restart VS Code after installing extensions
4. **Executable not found**:
- This usually means the program isn't in your PATH environment variable
- Check your PATH by opening PowerShell and running: `$env:Path -split ";"`
- You may need to add the relevant directory to your PATH:
  - Search for "Edit environment variables" in Windows
  - Edit the PATH variable and add the missing directory
  - Restart PowerShell/VS Code after making changes


## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Details
### VS Code Settings (.vscode folder)
This project includes customized VS Code settings to enhance your development experience:

- **settings.json**: Pre-configured editor settings optimized for Python and Jupyter notebooks
  - Code formatting and linting with Ruff
  - Jupyter notebook settings
  - Terminal integration with conda environments

- **extensions.json**: Recommended VS Code extensions for this project
  - Python and Jupyter support
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Docker integration
  - Markdown editing support

To use these settings, simply open the project in VS Code, and you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions.

### üîÑ Development Container (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
This project includes a Development Container configuration for consistent development environments across machines:

- Preconfigured Python environment with all dependencies installed
- VS Code extensions and settings automatically applied
- Isolated environment that won't affect your local system

To use the Development Container:
1. Install the "Remote - Containers" extension in VS Code
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette: "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and start (this may take a few minutes the first time)

Once inside the container, all tools and dependencies will be ready to use without manual installation.

### Configuration Files (.config folder)
The project contains configuration files in the `.config` folder:
- **ruff.toml**: Configuration for the Ruff Python linter and formatter

These configurations ensure consistent code style and environment settings across different development environments.
