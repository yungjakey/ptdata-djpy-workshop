## üîÑ Development Environment

### Dev Container
This project includes a Dev Container configuration for Visual Studio Code, which provides a consistent development environment. To use it:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VS Code
3. Open the project folder in VS Code and click "Reopen in Container" when prompted

### Setup
For those not using the Dev Container, the following installation instructions can be used for setting up the environment.

#### Setup scripts
The project includes setup scripts to automate the installation process:

- **Windows**: Run `scripts/setup.ps1` in PowerShell (with Administrator privileges)
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `scripts/setup.sh` in Terminal

These scripts will install Python 3.12, Miniconda, create a conda environment, and install required packages.

#### Additional tools
To install additional tools like Fabric:

- **Windows**: Run `scripts/tools.ps1` in PowerShell
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `scripts/tools.sh` in Terminal

These tools enhance the data journalism workflow with specialized capabilities.

#### Conda Environment
If you already set up everything, and want to reactivate your environment, run

```bash
# Activate the environment
conda activate djpyworkshop
```

### VS Code Settings (.vscode folder)
This project includes customized VS Code settings to enhance your development experience:

- **settings.json**: Pre-configured editor settings optimized for Python and Jupyter notebooks
  - Code formatting with Ruff
  - Python language server (Pylance) configuration
  - Jupyter notebook settings
  - Terminal integration with conda environments

- **extensions.json**: Recommended VS Code extensions for this project
  - Python and Jupyter support
  - Remote development capabilities
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Docker integration
  - Markdown editing support

To use these settings, simply open the project in VS Code, and you'll be prompted to install recommended extensions.

### Configuration Files (.config folder)
The project contains configuration files in the `.config` folder:

- **ruff.toml**: Configuration for the Ruff Python linter and formatter
- **.fabric/.env**: Environment variables for working with additional tools

These configurations ensure consistent code style and environment settings across different development environments.
